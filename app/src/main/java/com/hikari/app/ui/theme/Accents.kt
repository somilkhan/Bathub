/**
 * The app's accent colours (Settings → Appearance → Accent color).
 *
 * The app was built around a single amber/gold accent ([AMBER], the default)
 * and the player around the cyan→violet glow ([VIOLET], the default). Making
 * the accent a value that flows through the theme means one palette drives the
 * whole UI: every screen already paints itself from
 * `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary`, so only the scheme has to change.
 *
 * [start]/[end] are the two ends of the accent gradient, and they are the raw
 * source of truth: [mid] (the solid accent), [soft] (a darker shade for pressed
 * surfaces) and [ripple] are derived from them, and the native player draws its
 * pills/badges/time-bar from the same numbers (see PlayerActivity's
 * applyAccentPalette), so a colour picked here looks identical in both the
 * Compose UI and the View-based player.
